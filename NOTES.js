// Latest Notes


// OVERVIEW

1. 000 The circles for the information rollover currently have an “i’ for information, but it looks like the number “1”. Can we change the “i” to a “?”

2. 000 Remove “Event 1:” (just have the event title’s name: Myth and Classical Archetypes)

// 3. Consider fonts for banner, header, text, and quote. Any opportunies there for design?

4. 000 Change First Day to First Week

5. 000 Change “Previous Knowledge” to “Prerequisite” (that way we can later create those “prerequisite” courses to expand our curriculum)

// 6. I know it’s a bitch, but the rollover text says “unit” instead of “event”. I can go through those scripts and make those types of changes. I also see some grammatical errors in the Segue. Not a big deal for these points, but I have time to make the modifications, just send over the relevant scripts. Smart to have them all done up as separate objects. Good planning.

// 7. Design: Background with Diagonal Lines across to distinguish it from the foreground?

// 8. If possible, highlight the Lexis terms present in the Event Descriptor: archetypes, myth, dialectics, as hyperlinks to their lexis. Not necessary, but in the future you should be able to fluidly move through the system by hyperlinking to different lexis terms.

9. 000 I don’t like numbers. Change 1 = One and 2 = Two

// WEEKLY OUTLINE

1. 000 Move this dashboard item to just above Results page

2. “9th Grade Level 1” section selector could just be another input section because classes have lots of different names.

3. Cool that you’re figuring out how to do this. I’m sure it’s kind of a pain. I’ve been watching those javascript tutorials again. Gets complicated. We can figure out how to improve this section in the future.

// 4. Be nice if the printout had the IDEAL logo on it. Got to market where we can.

// PRIMARY READINGS

// 1. In the future, we should be able to rollover the Author’s Name to receive biographical information. By clicking on the author, we would be taken to a page where all of the author’s works present in the curriculum are displayed. Looks like we’ve got room for another icon on the dashboard, a cute little feather pen for Authors.

2. For all pages except overview (or all pages that specifically relate to this event, the banner should read the name of the Event (Myth and Classical Archetypes) because these specific readings, lexis, etc. are tied to this Event.

3. 000 I don’t like the word “Buy” on the purchase button. Change to: “Purchase” or “Add to Library”

4. 000 For Beginner text, in the parentheses on The Odyssey change Johnston = abridged

// LEXIS

// 1. Need rollover (?) with information on how to use the lexis. (Also need it for Further Readings.)

// 2. In the future, we’ll need to highlight certains terms in the Etymology and Applications (I have the highlights in my InDesign version of the dictionary) etymology highlight would point out the appropriate definition for easy visual access (definitionFocus and the application highlights will highlight lexis terms (connectedLexis) to be hyperlinked to other lexis 

// 3. In the future, looks like there will need to be a separate object (variable whatever) for the Author’s Name and the Title of the Text in the Quote. Some of the text titles for the quote need to be in italics.

// 4. In the future, need to have foreign words in italics. This is not altogether necessary, but since this is an education curriculum we need to be sure to signal certain academic standards.

// FURTHER READINGS

// 1. In the future, we could put the icons from the lexis above the titles in the Further Readings to indicate that these concepts, persons, devices, could be taught using this text. I could create key words just like I did for the Lexis. This feature would be very cool.

2 On the Poem (The Unknown Citizen as representative) the footnote highlights could probably just be bold without the light gray box background.

// 3. In the future, be nice to have a student version or a “homework” version of the Guiding Questions in the Poem where students could input their answer to the guiding questions. 

// 4. In the future, we could have a video tutorial annotating the poem or simply a version that highlights devices and concepts footnote style (I had thought of this for a “game” aspect where students earn the ability to see the footnotes). Common Core has videos for their “Close Reader” program. Something worth thinking about for far future development.

5. Minor point, but the line numbers are off on The Unknown Citizen. Line 1 falls on an empty line.

// 6. On the Performances, you have this nice little element where the square pops when you rollover. Can we make the Further Reading boxes do this too? Would add a little excitement to the page.
