From Greek algos “pain, grief, distress” + nostos “homecoming,” from neomai “to reach some place, escape, return, get home,” from nes- “to return safely home” (cognate with Old Norse nest “food for a journey,” Sanskrit nasate “approaches, joins,” German genesen “to recover,” Gothic ganisan “to heal,” Old English genesen “to recover”). French nostalgie is in French army medical manuals by 1754. By 1830s the word was used of any intense homesickness: that of sailors, convicts, African slaves. Transferred sense (the main modern one) of “wistful yearning for the past” first recorded 1920, perhaps from such use of nostalgie in French literature. The longing for a distant place also necessarily involves a separation in time.",
