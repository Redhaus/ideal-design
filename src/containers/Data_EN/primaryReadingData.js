                    title: 'The Odyssey (abridged)',
                    description: "Homer's Odyssey, composed in the eighth century BC, is the most influential and most popular epic poem in our cultural traditions. The story of Odysseus' adventures on his return home from the Trojan War has inspired the imaginations of readers for centuries and has become an integral part of our civilization's greatest artistic achievements, exerting its appeal on writers, painters, poets, film makers, and others, right up to the present time. Ian Johnston's abridged version of this magnificent poem, approximately one third the length of the original, is based upon his acclaimed new translation of the entire work. Every line in the abridged text comes from Homer's poem, and a few short summary comments are included to keep the narrative thrust of the action coherent. This abridgment also has explanatory footnotes, a glossary of names and places, a floor plan of Odysseus' palace, and a map of his route home. It thus serves as an ideal entry into Homer's poem for those who do not have the time yet to tackle the full poem.",

                    description: "The Odyssey is literature's grandest evocation of an everyman's journey through life. Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance.",

                    title: 'Metamorphoses',
                    description: "Ovid’s sensuous and witty poem brings together a dazzling array of mythological tales, ingeniously linked by the idea of transformation—often as a result of love or lust—where men and women find themselves magically changed into new and sometimes extraordinary beings. Beginning with the creation of the world and ending with the deification of Augustus, Ovid interweaves many of the best-known myths and legends of ancient Greece and Rome, including Daedalus and Icarus, Pyramus and Thisbe, Pygmalion, Perseus and Andromeda, and the fall of Troy. Erudite but light-hearted, dramatic and yet playful, Metamorphoses has influenced writers and artists throughout the centuries from Shakespeare and Titian to Picasso and Ted Hughes.",

                    title: 'Tales from Ovid',
                    description: "When it was published in 1997, Tales from Ovid was immediately recognized as a classic in its own right, as the best rendering of Ovid in generations, and as a major book in Ted Hughes's oeuvre. The Metamorphoses of Ovid stands with the works of Homer, Virgil, Dante, and Milton as a classic of world poetry; Hughes translated twenty-four of its stories with great power and directness. The result is the liveliest twentieth-century version of the classic, at once a delight for the Latinist and an appealing introduction to Ovid for the general reader.",
