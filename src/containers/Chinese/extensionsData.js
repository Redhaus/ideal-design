Masculine archetypes are also called “phallic” symbols. Feminine archetypes align with Dionysian concepts and are suggested by their shape. Feminine archetypes are also called “yonic” symbols. Students should be presented with the idea of identifying symbols as masculine or feminine based upon their shape. Phallic symbols suggest a dagger. Yonic symbols suggest a chalice. One easy way to tell the difference is that phallic symbols can be put inside of something while yonic symbols can have something put inside of them. Try giving the students random objects and having them place them into one of the two categories: house, shoe, pencil, skyscrapers.'

Useful for clearly illustrating the realm of transcendence (vertical) and immanence (horizontal); paradigmatic (vertical) and syntagmatic (horizontal); sky-father (vertical) and earth-mother (horizontal). It should also be pointed out that the individual subject is the meeting point of the two axes at (0,0). This extension also presents the opportunity to introduce some of the ideas of René Descartes as he is famous for the Cartesian coordinate system that we use to create these axes. Descartes can also be used to present the mind-body problem, commonly known as Cartesian dualism, as well as the metaphysical truth, “I think, therefore, I am” (French: Je pense, donc, je suis; Latin: cogito ergo sum).'

    rollover: 'This concept from Carl Jung is used to explain the apparent transhistoric and transcultural nature of archetypal symbols. In other words, Jung proposes that there are symbols that cross time and space, always seeming to carry masculine or feminine suggestions regardless of history or culture. Because he finds such symbols, Jung proposed the idea of a “collective unconscious”, an unconsciousness that we all share. One way of communicating this idea is to draw a parallel between the collective unconscious and instinct.'

    rollover: 'In psychology, the concept that an abundance of any force can cause an opposite reaction. The concept is originally attributed to Heraclitus, but Carl Jung applied it in psychology to the depth and height of our emotional states being equal in their difference. In other words, if an individual is capable of extreme happiness, then they are equally capable of extreme despair. Concept can be tied to that of the dialectic where history is a movement between opposing forces. For example, an application to the food industry might be the health food movement as a reaction to fast food. We also see a dialectic, or enantiodromic, movement in politics, from left to right and back again.',

    rollover: 'Everything is a myth. Roland Barthes defines “speech” as myth in his Mythologies. Since everything “speaks,” we can then argue that everything is a myth. This has affinities with Jacques Lacans understanding that we do not experience the Real, but the Imaginary. Too, there are similarities in physics where we do not experience the actual world through our senses because the microscopic is invisible. Northrup Frye writes: “Every sequence in words, just by virtue of the fact that it is a sequence, is a verbal structure in which the words have their own pattern and their own forms. It is impossible to describe anything with definitive accuracy in the outside world by means of words, because words are always forming their own self-contained patterns of subject, predicate and object. They are continually shaping reality into what are essentially a grammatical function.” Furthermore, according to Walter Lippman in his PUBLIC OPINION, we do not have access to the larger world as it is too large and complex for understanding so we must model it on a simpler form. However you view it, we “construct” a reality that is essentially mythical so that the vast world becomes manageable and navigable.'

There is no good without evil, no beauty without ugliness, no night without day. For every x there is a not-x. This is the apparently inescapable prison of human understanding.'
