    history: "The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery stands atop a hill overlooking Washington, D.C. On March 4, 1921, Congress approved the burial of an unidentified American soldier from World War I in the plaza of the new Memorial Amphitheater. The white marble sarcophagus has a flat-faced form and is relieved at the corners and along the sides by neo-classic pilasters, or columns, set into the surface. Sculpted into the east panel which faces Washington, D.C., are three Greek figures representing Peace, Victory, and Valor. The six wreaths, three sculpted on each side, represent the six major campaigns of World War I.",

    history: "Henry Ford built his first automobile, which he called a quadricycle, at his home in Detroit in 1896. The location has been redeveloped, where the Michigan Building now stands, and the tracks for the Detroit People Mover and the Times Square People Mover station are nearby. At the entrance to the Michigan Building, there is a commemorative plaque identifying the original location of the Ford home. The coal shed has been recreated using the original bricks at Greenfield Village in nearby Dearborn.[1] His initial foray into automobile manufacturing was the Detroit Automobile Company, founded in 1899. The company foundered, and in 1901 was reorganized as the Henry Ford Company. In March 1902, after falling out with his financial backers, Ford left the company with the rights to his name and 900 dollars. The Ford Motor Company went on to become one of the largest corporations in the world and mainstreamed  Adam Smith's 'Division of Labor' ideas into his assembly line production process.",

    history: "Scabs is a derogatory name for union members who refuse to go out on strike or workers who are hired by businesses to replace striking workers. During the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries, strikes were commonplace within the United States. Numerous unions, including the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor, originated during this time period. Many of these groups' members supported strikes to gain improved conditions for workers. Unfortunately for the strikers, an abundance of laborers existed within the United States during this era. Many people, especially recent immigrants, did not have jobs. When workers went on strike, businesses could easily hire new laborers, known as scabs, to replace the striking workers. Often, the new employees were willing to work for less pay than the laborers whom they were replacing. Violence often erupted between the strikers and the scabs. Strikers were unhappy with union members who remained at work and sometimes utilized violence against these scabs. Strikers also commonly utilized violence and verbal intimidation against new workers as well. While working conditions dramatically improved throughout the twentieth century, strikes still occur today. Businesses commonly hire scabs to replace the strikers, and violence and intimidation still occur, although much less regularly than before.",

    annotation: "A system for purchasing merchandise in which the buyer takes possession of the merchandise on payment of a deposit and completes the purchase by paying a series of regular installments while the seller retains ownership until the final installment is paid",
    history: "Since many goods were too expensive, people could use installment plans to fix the situation. At the time, they had a bad reputation, so no one was really willing to use them. Companies decided to use advertisement to change public perception. By the 1920's almost everyone was using installment plans. The installment plan enabled people to buy goods over an extended period of time, without having to put down very much money at the time of purchase. With this plan people could purchase automobile, household appliances, homes, furniture, and other items.",

    annotation: "Eugenics: a set of beliefs and practices that aims at improving the genetic quality of a human population",
    history: "It is important to understand the cultural background of the era that created this field of science.‚Äù  After the Civil War, there was turbulent economy and an influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe.  The economy of the US had rapid fluctuations and remained in this tenuous manner until WWI.  As the economy became more uncertain, the social inequalities between different segments of society became more visible. In the same era,the idea of Social Darwinism became popular and was used to explain these social inequalities.  Social Darwinism utilizes the concept of natural selection from Charles Darwin and applies it to society.  Social Darwinism explains survival of the fittest in terms of the capability of an individual to survive within a competitive environment.  This explains social inequalities by explaining that the wealthy are better individuals and therefore better suited to survive in the uncertain economy.  In terms of survival of the fittest the wealthy are more likely to survive and produce more offspring than the poor. However, this was not occurring.  The birthrate of the elite was declining while the birthrate of the poor was increasing.  Meanwhile governmental social programs and aid were doing little help the increasing poverty.  The government utilized the idea of scientific management, known as progressivism.  Progressive reformers relied on science to control both nature and human society.  This view of science as a method of reform and the newly rediscovered science of genetics gave rise to social engineering",
